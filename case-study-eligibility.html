                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>
                        "I spent three hours enrolling new hires yesterday, and I'm still not sure I did it right." This from an HR director managing benefits for 500 employees. The enrollment system forced her to jump between screens, remember which fields were required, and hope she hadn't missed anything critical. No preview. No confirmation. Just submit and pray.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The real cost? Employees discovering they had no coverage when they went to fill a prescription. Coverage gaps weren't just administrative errors—they were families facing unexpected medical bills because someone checked the wrong box or left a field blank.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During open enrollment, the system's limitations became painful: processing 200 employees one by one, each taking 10-15 minutes, with no way to catch errors until after submission. HR teams worked nights and weekends, anxious about missing the deadline or making mistakes that would affect real people's healthcare access.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <!-- My Role -->
                <section class="case-study-section">
                    <h2>My Role</h2>
                    <p>
                        I led design for the employer eligibility redesign within a cross-functional team, from initial research through final implementation. I conducted user research, defined the information architecture, designed interfaces, and partnered with product managers and engineers on prioritization and technical constraints.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This required balancing competing needs: administrators wanted speed and efficiency, but we couldn't sacrifice accuracy. The system needed to handle both routine enrollments and complex edge cases like retroactive coverage and life events.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <!-- The Approach -->
                <section class="case-study-section">
                    <h2>The Approach</h2>

                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                    <p>
                        I watched five HR administrators enroll employees in their actual work environment. Not in a conference room—at their desks, with interruptions, phone calls, and the pressure of real deadlines. The patterns were clear: they kept notes in Excel because the system didn't tell them what was required. They submitted forms, fingers crossed, because there was no preview. They dreaded the "error" message that appeared only after submission, forcing them to start over.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One administrator showed me her spreadsheet with 200 names for open enrollment. "I'll spend the next two weeks on this," she said. "And I'll still make mistakes because I'm exhausted by employee number 50."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The research revealed something critical: administrators don't want flexibility—they want guidance. Tell them exactly what's needed, when it's needed, and whether they got it right before they submit.
                    </p>

                    <div class="case-study-image">
                        <img src="images/eligibility-research.jpg" alt="User Research Findings Summary" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover;">
                    </div>

                    <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
                    <p>
                        The old system was organized like a database: "Employee Information," "Coverage Details," "Dependent Data." That's how engineers think, not how HR administrators work. I reorganized around actual tasks: "Enroll New Hire," "Add Baby After Birth," "Update Address," "Process Open Enrollment."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now when an HR admin needs to add coverage for a new baby, they click "Add Dependent" and answer exactly the questions needed for that scenario. No navigating to Employee > Dependents > Coverage > Effective Date. Just a guided flow that asks the right questions in the right order.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This task-oriented approach eliminated the mental overhead of "where do I enter this information?" The system knows what you're trying to do and shows you exactly the path to do it.
                    </p>

                    <div class="case-study-image">
                        <img src="images/eligibility-task-flow.jpg" alt="Task Flow Diagram" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover;">
                    </div>

                    <h3>Interface Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        Real-time validation means no more "submit and hope." Type an invalid Social Security Number? The field tells you immediately: "Format should be ###-##-####" with the correct example right there. Enter a dependent's birth date in the future? "Birth date cannot be after today" appears instantly. No waiting until submission to discover what went wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The review step became the moment of confidence. Before clicking "Submit," administrators see every piece of information they entered, organized clearly. "John Smith, hired April 1st, family coverage, no dependents yet." If something's wrong, edit that section right there—no starting over.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This isn't just better UX—it's preventing real harm. An HR admin who catches a coverage error before submission just saved an employee from a potential coverage gap when they need medical care.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Bulk Enrollment</h3>
                    <p>
                        For bulk enrollment, I designed a spreadsheet upload flow with intelligent error detection that flags issues row by row, allowing administrators to fix problems without starting over. The system highlights exactly which rows have errors and what's wrong, making corrections straightforward.
                    </p>

                    <div class="case-study-image">
                        <img src="images/eligibility-bulk-upload.jpg" alt="Bulk Upload Interface with Error Handling" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover;">
                    </div>

                    <h3>Accessibility <h4>Accessibility & Edge Cases</h4> Edge Cases</h3>
                    <p>
                        I designed for keyboard-only navigation, screen reader compatibility, and clear focus states. I mapped out edge cases: What happens with name changes? Retroactive coverage? Dependent verification? Each scenario has a clear, documented flow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These edge cases are rare but critical. When they occur, administrators need confidence that the system handles them correctly—especially when dealing with sensitive healthcare coverage.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <!-- The Outcome -->
                <section class="case-study-section">
                    <h2>The Outcome</h2>
                    <p>
                        That HR director who spent three hours enrolling new hires? She now processes the same enrollments in 45 minutes. More importantly, she sleeps better knowing the review step caught the errors she would have missed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Open enrollment transformed from HR's most dreaded deadline to a manageable process. The bulk upload processes 200 employees in hours instead of weeks. When errors occur, the system points directly to the problem: "Row 47: Birth date required for dependent." Fix it and continue—no starting over.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The real measure isn't efficiency—it's the absence of coverage gap complaints. When employees can fill prescriptions and get care without surprise billing issues, that's the design working. We catch errors before they affect real people's healthcare access.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One administrator's feedback captures it: "I used to lie awake wondering if I missed something. Now I trust the system to catch my mistakes before they matter."
                    </p>

                    <div class="case-study-image">

                    </div>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">What I'd Do Differently</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'd watch more HR admins during actual open enrollment—not just regular enrollment. The pressure of deadlines reveals different behaviors and needs than everyday workflows. Those insights would have shaped the bulk upload feature earlier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'd prototype the review step first and test it aggressively. It became the most praised feature, but I almost cut it for being "an extra click." User testing proved that preventing one coverage gap justifies a hundred extra clicks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'd build analytics from day one to track where users struggle: which validations trigger most often, where they abandon flows, which error messages get ignored. Data would guide iteration better than assumptions.
