# Quick Start Guide

Get the portfolio running in under 1 minute!

## Option 1: One-Command Start (Easiest) ⚡

Run the start script:

```bash
./start.sh
```

This will automatically:
- Detect if you have Python 3 or Node.js installed
- Start a local server on port 8000
- Open your browser automatically

## Option 2: Using npm 📦

```bash
npm start
```

This will start http-server and open your browser.

## Option 3: Python Server 🐍

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open: http://localhost:8000

## Option 4: Node.js Server 📗

```bash
npx http-server -p 8000 -o
```

Browser will open automatically.

## Option 5: Direct File Access 📁

Just double-click `index.html` - it works directly in the browser!

> **Note:** Some features like fonts may work better with a local server.
