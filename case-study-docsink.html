                <!-- The Challenge -->
                <section class="case-study-section">
                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>
                        Businesses across industries—fitness studios, adventure sports, events, healthcare clinics—were still using paper waivers or clunky PDF solutions. They needed a way to create professional digital waivers, collect signatures on any device, manage signed documents, and maintain compliance. But building a waiver platform meant designing for two very different users: the business administrators who create and manage waivers, and the end customers who sign them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Paper waivers created operational friction—they had to be printed, stored physically, and were difficult to search or retrieve. PDF solutions weren't much better—they often didn't work well on mobile, required apps to sign, and lacked management features. The market needed a modern, mobile-first solution.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <!-- My Role -->
                <section class="case-study-section">
                    <h2>My Role</h2>
                    <p>
                        As the product designer on this early-stage product, I worked within a cross-functional SaaS team and owned the design process from concept through launch. I conducted competitive analysis, defined the product strategy alongside the founder and product partner, designed interfaces with engineering input, built the design system, and created prototypes for user testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was a 0-to-1 product where I shaped both the vision and execution with engineering and product stakeholders. Decisions—from the waiver builder's interaction model to the signing experience's visual design—were validated through reviews and implementation discussions.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <!-- The Approach -->
                <section class="case-study-section">
                    <h2>The Approach</h2>

                    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                    <p>
                        I analyzed 8 competing waiver solutions, documenting strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in the market. Key opportunities: most competitors offered rigid templates with limited customization, poor mobile signing experiences, and no analytics on waiver performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I identified that the best solutions balanced flexibility with ease of use—they offered templates for speed but allowed customization for specific needs. The worst required too much technical knowledge to create a simple waiver.
                    </p>

                    <div class="case-study-image">
                        <img src="images/docsink-competitive-analysis.jpg" alt="Competitive Analysis Matrix" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover;">
                    </div>

                    <h3>Two-User Design Challenge</h3>
                    <p>
                        I approached this as two interconnected products with distinct needs:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>For business administrators:</strong><br>
                        A waiver builder with drag-and-drop simplicity but powerful customization. Template library for common use cases. Dashboard with signing status, expiration alerts, and analytics. Team management and permission controls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>For end customers signing waivers:</strong><br>
                        Clean, focused signing experience with no distractions. Works seamlessly on any device (critical for on-site signing on tablets). Clear progress indication for multi-page waivers. Accessible signature capture (draw, type, or upload).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Waiver Builder</h3>
                    <p>
                        I designed a block-based builder where administrators construct waivers from pre-built elements: text blocks, checkboxes, signature fields, date fields, and more. Each block has customization options appropriate to its type. Preview mode shows exactly how the waiver will appear to signers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Templates speed up common use cases (gym liability waiver, event participation waiver, medical consent form) while remaining fully customizable. Businesses can start with a template and adjust it to their specific needs.
                    </p>

                    <div class="case-study-image">
                        <img src="images/docsink-builder.jpg" alt="Waiver Builder Interface" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover;">

                    </div>

                    </div>

                    <h3>Admin Dashboard</h3>
                    <p>
                        I designed a dashboard that provides at-a-glance status: how many waivers signed this week, which waivers are expiring soon, and quick access to common tasks. Administrators can filter signed waivers, export to PDF, and manage team access.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Analytics show which waivers are being used most, where users are dropping off in the signing process, and signing trends over time. This data helps businesses optimize their waiver process.
                    </p>

                    <div class="case-study-image">
                        <img src="images/docsink-dashboard.jpg" alt="Admin Dashboard Overview" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover;">
                    </div>

                    <h3>Signing Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        I stripped away everything unnecessary. The signing interface is just the waiver content and clear next/sign/done actions. Progress indicators show completion status. Signature capture works via touch, mouse, or typed name—accommodating different devices and user preferences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Confirmation emails include a PDF copy of the signed waiver, so customers have a record. This builds trust and reduces support requests from customers wondering if their signature was captured.
                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <h3>Design System</h3>
                    <p>
                        I built a complete design system from scratch—component library, spacing system, color palette, typography—ensuring consistency across the admin and signing experiences while maintaining distinct visual contexts for each.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The admin interface needed to feel professional and efficient—supporting complex workflows. The signing experience needed to feel simple and approachable—reducing anxiety around legal documents.
                    </p>

                    <div class="case-study-image">
                        <img src="images/docsink-design-system.jpg" alt="Design System Documentation" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover;">
                    </div>
                </section>

                <!-- The Outcome -->
                <section class="case-study-section">
                    <h2>The Outcome</h2>
                    <p>
                        DOCS.ink launched with a product that businesses could immediately start using. The waiver builder's simplicity meant zero training required—administrators created their first waiver within minutes. The template library accelerated adoption, with most users starting from a template rather than building from scratch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The signing experience's focus on mobile usability proved essential, as most signatures happened on tablets at business locations—gyms, rock climbing facilities, event venues. The streamlined flow kept completion rates high even for multi-page waivers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The platform now serves businesses across fitness, outdoor recreation, events, and healthcare, handling thousands of signatures monthly. Businesses particularly value the ability to search signed waivers instantly—something impossible with paper or PDF solutions.
                    </p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Key Learnings</h3>
                    <p>
                        Designing for two distinct user types required clear separation of contexts. The admin builder and signing experience needed to feel like coherent parts of the same product while serving completely different mental models.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Templates were more valuable than I initially expected. While I built a powerful custom builder, most users wanted to start from a template and make minor adjustments rather than build from scratch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mobile-first design for the signing experience was critical. Early prototypes that looked great on desktop felt cramped and difficult on mobile. Designing for mobile first, then scaling up, produced a better experience across all devices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Building a design system upfront, even as a small team, paid dividends. It ensured consistency and made implementation faster—design handoffs were clearer and developers could align to shared patterns.
